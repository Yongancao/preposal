# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Last Survivor 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

It will be a shooting horde survival game where you control your character and kill zombies that will spawn and try to kill you.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The project will be made on unity. My software is a game. You control your character to shoot enemy zombies that will spawn and follow your character. There might be powerups and upgrades that will make your character stronger. It can easily be executed by downloading the game and playing it.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

none

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Frank Zhang, tup88114@temple.edu, the TA is Bin Li

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome for my final project would be able to run the game and have my character able to move and shoot enemies.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be to implement upgrades and levels which will make your character stronger and spawn more enemies as time goes on to make it be to survive as long as possible or to make waves that you have to beat. Also, to add bosses that spawns at specific times.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would be to have all of the better outcome ideas, and make it like a game that is able to be released to the public, where there is a title, good art, sounds, and have no bugs.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

New skills I will need are to learn out to code in Unity, I will have to do a lot of research to learn how unity works and how to make a game. My classmate will do the basics coding the game to make the character and shoot while I will work on trying to make the game better and more details.
